abstract: Pet adoption in the Philippines has experienced significant growth in recent years, highlighting the increasing demand for effective shelter management and streamlined adoption processes. Despite this, many shelters face challenges such as overcrowding, limited resources, manual record-keeping, and inefficient communication with potential adopters. These issues hinder timely access to accurate information about adoptable dogs, reduce adoption rates, and negatively affect public perception of shelters. Existing pet adoption platforms often provide limited information, lack user-friendly interfaces, and fail to offer comprehensive features that enhance the adoption experience. To address these gaps, a centralized web application is proposed to support shelters in Metro Manila by offering real-time updates, searchable dog profiles, digital adoption forms, and direct communication channels with shelter staff. Additionally, an integrated recommendation system can personalize matches between adopters and pets, improving adoption outcomes and ensuring pets are placed in suitable homes. By consolidating data management, automating processes, and enhancing user engagement, this solution aims to increase operational efficiency, improve animal welfare, and promote successful pet adoptions in the Philippines.

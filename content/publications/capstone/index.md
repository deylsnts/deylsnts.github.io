abstract: Pet adoption in the Philippines is growing, but shelters face challenges like overcrowding, limited resources, manual record-keeping, and poor communication, which hinder adoption rates and public perception. Existing platforms are often limited and difficult to use. To address this, a centralized web application is proposed for Metro Manila shelters, offering real-time dog profiles, digital adoption forms, direct communication with staff, and a recommendation system to match pets with suitable adopters. This solution aims to improve shelter efficiency, enhance animal welfare, and increase successful adoptions.
